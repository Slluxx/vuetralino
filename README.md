# neutralinojs-template

Neutralino + Vite + VueJS

```
neu create myapp --template slluxx/vuetralino
```

Note: 
- A workaround has been added for https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/1179
- Sometimes there is a bug with websockets, simply refresh the page and it should be resolved.
- If vite uses a different port on your machine, change it in `neutralino.config.json` all the way at the bottom
